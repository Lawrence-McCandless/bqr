# Bayesian Quantile Regression
R and Stan code for Bayesian quantile regression based on the asymetric Laplace distribution first proposed by Yu and Moyeed (2001) Statistics and Probability Letters, 54, 437-447.  

The repository includes codes for calculating robust posterior credible intervals for model parameters, and additionally code for the Bayesian method for assessing the presence of heteroscedastic errors in the outcome variable.
